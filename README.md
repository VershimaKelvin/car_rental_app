## Project Overview

The app has a beautiful User interface to ease user interactivity, high quality images to show what cars are available for hire. The project waS built using most recent packages to avoid quick future deprecation of any package.
The app offers information such as the type of gear box(Automatic or manual), Engine type(V6 or V4), color, and number of seat, thereby giving the user a wide range of options to pick from. The app is easy to use and understand its process flow.
